# stockmarket-simulation
This Python project simulates future stock prices using historical data from NSE. It applies Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and runs Monte Carlo simulations to generate potential future paths and analyze risk.
## Features
- Fetches NSE stock data using yFinance
- Calculates log returns, drift, and volatility
- Runs 1000+ Monte Carlo simulations
- Visualizes projected paths and ending price distribution
## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- yFinance
- Matplotlib
## Note
This is part of my exploration into stochastic finance and risk modeling. Contributions or suggestions are welcome!
